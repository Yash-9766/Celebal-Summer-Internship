ðŸŒž My Summer Internship Gem: Bringing AI to Life with InceptionResNetV2!

ðŸš€ Thrilled to share the results of my summer internship project, where I dove deep into the world of computer vision and deep learning. With the mighty InceptionResNetV2 as my partner in code, we unlocked the incredible potential of recognizing human actions. From those scorching summer days to lines of code, this project encapsulates my passion for innovation and my journey in mastering the art of AI.

ðŸ’ƒ From dance moves to sports tricks, this project 'sees' and understands human actions. It's not just about a successful internship; it's about a season of growth, learning, and making AI come to life. Grateful for the opportunity and excited to keep pushing the boundaries of technology!
